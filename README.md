# Aranym's Wallpaper Collection

## Where Did I Get These?

I find wallpapers in a number of different locations but good places to check out include [r/wallpapers](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpapers/) and [/wg/](http://4chan.org/wg). Some of these wallpapers were included in default wallpaper packages from various operating systems that I have installed over the years.

## Ownership

Because I downloaded most of these from sites like Reddit and /wg/, I have no way of knowing if there is a copyright on these images. If you find an image hosted in this repository that is yours and of limited use, please let me know and I will remove it.
